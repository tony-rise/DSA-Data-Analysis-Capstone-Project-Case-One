# DSA Data Analysis Capstone Project Documentation

## Introduction: 
My name Ibor Anthony Nornu from Rivers State (Nigeria) a student of the Incubator Hub (Digital SkillUp Africa Training Programme). My course of choice was Data Analysis and it was really an interesting journey for the past three (3) months. I have gone through an extensive mentorship session in Microsoft Excel, Structured Query Language (SQL) and Power BI.

I have been mentored by industry expert facilitators with so many years of experience in the Data space and also connected with Squad mates from various part of the country and beyond.

This project is where I started to showcase my technical/digital skills in Data Analysis that I acquired from the Incubator Hub (DSA) with practical hands-one training to demonstrate my analytical thinking, technical skill, and storytelling capabilities through data.


## Project Instructions
We are required to select any 2 out of the 3 case studies shared with us for this project. For each selected case study, we are to carry out a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using the appropriate analytical tools and techniques relevant to the context of each dataset accordingly.


## Table of Content

### Data Source
For the DSA Capstone Project, all the necessary Data set required to carry-out this detailed analysis were shared on our Learning Management System (LMS) Powered by Canvas.
In view of this, my Data Source for this project was the Learning Management System (LSM) by CANVAS.


## Tools Usage
The following applications were installed for our lectures and was also be utilized for the duration of this project. The facilitators guided us thoroughly on the use of this applications during the course of the training to enable us get the best results in our Data Analysis journey.
- Microsoft Excel [DOWNLOAD HERE](https://www.microsoft.com/en/microsoft-365/excel?market=af#Plans-pricing)
  - Primarily used for organizing, calculating, and analyzing data through spreadsheets.
- SQL Server Management Studio [DOWNLOAD HERE](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ssms/install/install)
  - Used to connect to and manage SQL Server instances, including creating, modifying, and deleting databases etc.
- Power Business Integration (BI) [DOWNLOAD HERE](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=58494)
  - Used to transform and model that data, and then create interactive dashboards and reports to gain insights and make data-driven decisions.


## Project Structure
Selected Case Study 1 (Amazon Product Review Analysis)

### Case Study Overview
I was working as a Junior Data Analyst at RetailTech Insights, a company that provides e-commerce analytics solutions to sellers on platforms like Amazon. My team has been tasked with analysing product and customer review data to generate insights that can guide product improvement, marketing strategies, and customer engagement. 


## Dataset Description
The dataset contains information scraped from Amazon product pages, including: 
• Product details: name, category, price, discount, and ratings 
• Customer engagement: user reviews, titles, and content 
• Each row represents a unique product, with aggregated reviewer data stored as comma-separated values 
Total Records: 1,465 Rows
Total Fields: 16 columns


## Explanatory Data Analysis (EDA)
This process involved the exploration of the Data Set that was made available on our LMS (by CANVAS)  to find solution to the following questions: 
1. What is the average discount percentage by product category? 
2. How many products are listed under each category? 
3. What is the total number of reviews per category? 
4. Which products have the highest average ratings? 
5. What is the average actual price vs the discounted price by category? 
6. Which products have the highest number of reviews? 
7. How many products have a discount of 50% or more? 
8. What is the distribution of product ratings (e.g., how many products are rated 3.0, 4.0, etc.)? 
9. What is the total potential revenue (actual_price × rating_count) by category? 
10. What is the number of unique products per price range bucket (e.g., ₹500)? 
11. How does the rating relate to the level of discount? 
12. How many products have fewer than 1,000 reviews? 
13. Which categories have products with the highest discounts? 
14. Identify the top 5 products in terms of rating and number of reviews combined.


## Results (Dashboards)
After a painstaking, Exploratory Data Analysis, I arrived at the following results: [DOWNLOAD HERE](https://limewire.com/d/zzyK8#y5GojZsUWi)


## Recommendations
I hereby recommend the following to guide product improvement, marketing strategies, and customer engagement.

- For product improvement, I strongly recommend that the company make good use of product review and sales data to recognize products commonly purchased together and then propose      
  bundle offerings to increase average order value.
- Regarding marketing strategies, I am recommending that the company groups positive/negative reviews into segment by customer location, product categories etc, then tailor campaigns 
  accordingly.
- Finally on customer engagement, I hereby recommend that the company establishes an effective public platform/procedure to respond to reviews ratings lower than 3.00 atleast and profer    solution within 48hours. 


## Contributions
- In the course of this project Exploratory Data Analysis, I presented insights that led to a redesign of products that were underperforming  and had about 12% improvement in average product ratings.
- I assisted product managers to prioritize feature updates and optimize packaging/descriptions based on real customer input.
