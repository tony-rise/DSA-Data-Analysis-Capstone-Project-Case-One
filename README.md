# Project Topic: DSA Data Analysis Capstone Project Documentation

# Introduction: 
My name Ibor Anthony Nornu from Rivers State (Nigeria) a student of the Incubator Hub (Digital SkillUp Africa Training Programme). My course of choice was Data Analysis and it was really an interesting journey for the past three (3) months. I have gone through an extensive mentorship session in Microsoft Excel, Structured Query Language (SQL) and Power BI.

I have been mentored by industry expert facilitators with so many years of experience in the Data space and also connected with Squad mates from various part of the country and beyond.

This project is where I started to showcase my technical/digital skills in Data Analysis that I acquired from the Incubator Hub (DSA) with practical hands-one training to demonstrate my analytical thinking, technical skill, and storytelling capabilities through data.
